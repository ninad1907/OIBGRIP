            <b>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar</b> also known as <b>Veer Savarkar</b>
            , was an Indian politician, activist, and writer . Vinayak Damodar Savarkar 
            was born on 28 May 1883 in the Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin Hindu family in the
            village of Bhagur, near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra . Savarkar was greatly 
            influenced by the radical Nationalist leader, Lokmanya Tilak . Savarkar began his 
            political activities as a high school student and continued to do so at Fergusson 
            College in Pune . He and his brother founded a secret society called Abhinav Bharat 
            Society. Abhinav Bharat's main objectives were to overthrow British rule and reviving 
            Hindu pride . Savarkar endorsed the idea of India as a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Nation) . 
            Savarkar was sentenced to life terms of imprisonment totaling fifty years and was moved 
            to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . He wrote 38 books in English 
            and Marathi , consisting in many essays, two novels called Moplah Rebellion and the Transportation,
             poetry and plays, the best-known of his books being his historical study The Indian war of independence,
              1857 and his pamphlet Hindutva: Who Is a Hindu?.
